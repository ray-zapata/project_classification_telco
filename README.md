## I. Project Goals

This project holds the intent of predicting and reducing churn at Telco Inc., a telecommunication company that provides telephony and internet services to members of the consumer class. Churn in this context refers to the act of customer services and subscriptions being terminated, also known as attrition or turnover. Our goal is to find drivers of churn in the existing data and use machine learning models to predict further incidence in test samples. From there we will recommend actions to improve customer retention in these areas of high churn.

## II. Project Deliverables

- Jupyter Notebook Report which contains the process of exploring, modeling, and testing
- This README which contains:
  + Project goals, findings, and takeaways
  + Data context
  + Data science pipeline process
  + Instructions on reproducing
- CSV with `customer_id`, `probability_of_churn`, and `prediction_of_churn`
- Modules as `.py` files containing functions to acquire and prepare data
- Jupyter Notebook Presentation with high-level overview of project

## III. Data Context


#### 1. Database Relationship

The Codeup `telco_churn` SQL database contains four tables: `customers`, `contract_types`, `internet_service_types`, and `payment_types`. These tables are connected in the manner defined in the following image with foreign key links being represented by connecting arrows to two highlighted keys. This database is read into a pandas DataFrame and prepared in the manner described in the data dictionary below.

#### 2. Data Dictionary

Following acquisition and preparation of the initial SQL database, the DataFrames used in this project contain the following variables. Contained values are defined along with their respective data types.
